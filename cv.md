*My nickname on DIscord.com Ilya_Karachun*

I live in Minsk.  I study WEB-development at Yandex.Practicum. I want to change my specialty and get new skills. I only do two things best in my life. This is study and work. I just want better conditions for work and life. Graduated Belarusian State Medical University in 2018.

My current skills:
- HTML5.
- CSS.
- basic JS.


### I made two projects at Yandex.Praktikum:
- [My first project made on FLex and without adaptive](https://ilyakarachun.github.io/ikarachun.com/)
- [My second project made on mix Flex&Grid](https://ilyakarachun.github.io/russian-travel/)

```
function multiply(a, b){
  return a * b;
}
```
